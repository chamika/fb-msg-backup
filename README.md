#Message Backup for Facebook Android app

## Introduction
Message Backup for Facebook is an Android app which downloads chat/message conversations between the user and others.
It generates a .csv file containing sender, receiver, date-time and the message.

After Facebook restricted 3rd party applications to retrieve user messages the application was unable to access the messages for normal users, but facebook app developers still can access them.


## Installation
This is an eclipse project. Open from eclipse and build.
